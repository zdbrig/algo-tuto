# Algorand Programming Tutorial

Welcome to the Algorand Programming Tutorial! This tutorial is designed to introduce you to programming on the Algorand blockchain using the Algorand SDK. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with blockchain development, this tutorial will help you get up to speed with Algorand.

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorial, you'll need to have some basic programming knowledge, as well as an understanding of the Algorand blockchain. If you're new to Algorand, we recommend checking out the Algorand developer documentation [here](https://developer.algorand.org/). 

To complete the tutorial, you'll also need to have some software installed on your computer. Specifically, you'll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Algorand SDK](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/reference/sdks/)
- [Algod](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/)

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can clone the repository and start working through the tutorial.

## Tutorial Content

The tutorial consists of a series of modules, each covering a different aspect of Algorand programming. Here's an overview of the modules included in the tutorial:

1. Introduction to Algorand
2. Creating and Managing Algorand Accounts
3. Sending and Receiving Algorand Transactions
4. Smart Contracts on Algorand
5. Building Algorand dApps

Each module includes a series of code examples and exercises that you can use to practice and solidify your understanding of the concepts covered. We encourage you to work through each module in order, as later modules build on concepts covered in earlier ones.
